        <h2>2022-12-20</h2>
        <p>this is a test</p>
        <p><strong>*taps mic*</strong> It took awhile, but I'm finally getting around to getting started on this project.</p>
        <p><em>"What project?"</em> You may ask.</p><p></p>
        <p>I'm currently working on web development skills so I can create a space that really encapsulates who I am.</p>
        <p>I like challenging tasks, and coming up with creative solutions.</p>
        <p>It's a passion I've cultivated through Melee and has grown well beyond it.</p>
        <p>Programming offers a robust way to communicate and problem-solve in the modern day.</p>
        <p>Through programming and Linguistics, I'm able to communicate these ideas to you.</p>
        <p>When I've told people I'm studying Linguistics, often they wonder,</p>
        <p><em>"Yeah, but what are you going to do with that?"</em> Without realizing how quickly they are processing what I am saying in real-time.</p>
        <p>People have an <strong>incredible capacity</strong> to process sound and text.</p>
        <p>Humans are trained on considerably less information than computers, which have an immense capacity for learning.</p>
        <p>Yet with comparatively less information, people have a near infinite capacity for processing new words and sentences in increasing contexts.</p>
        <p>We have data factories designed to process more data points than humans can retain in memory.</p>
        <p>Artificial intelligence is becoming more pertinent by the day, but people can't seem to bridge the gap between language and technology.</p>
        <p>You may think, <em>"We already have powerful translation tools, predictive text generators, and live interpreting apps"</em></p>
        <p>But if you seriously look into these tools and study Linguistics, you'll realize a lot is lost in translation.</p>
        <p>Web development is one way I'll be able to get these thoughts out there.</p>
        <p>I often have thoughts about a variety of topics, but social media doesn't feel like the place for it.</p>
        <p>Social media platforms bear this burden of generating impressions, which give metrics to your thoughts and feelings.</p>
        <p>If who you are or what you think doesn't generate impressions, is it important?</p>
        <p>However, going too far in the other direction is also likely unhealthy, as we are social creatures.</p>
        <p>Learning how to incorporate more balance into my life is the goal right now.</p>
        <p>Thank you,</p>
        <p>-AN</p>
